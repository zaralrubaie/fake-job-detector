### How to use the demo:

1. Enter the job posting text or paste the job description you want to check.  
2. Click the **Detect** button.  
3. See the modelâ€™s prediction and confidence score instantly.
Feel free to try multiple examples and explore how the model helps spot fake job ads!

##  About the Project
This project aims to fight online recruitment fraud by automatically identifying fake job listings using:

-  **TinyBERT**: A pretrained transformer model optimized for small devices and fast inference.
- **CustomTinyBERTClassifier**: A lightweight classifier that adds domain-specific features (e.g., salary inconsistencies, suspicious keywords, formatting patterns).
-  **LLM-enhanced pipeline**: Boosts performance with deeper language understanding and cross-feature correlation.

## Features

- Detects fake job posts using both raw text and additional metadata
- Fast inference using TinyBERT
- Combines LLM embeddings + custom feature engineering
- Simple, clean interface (built with Streamlit / Gradio)
